# Data-Analysis-Projects

These are a collection of my data analysis projects.

**_GenderWageGapMath_** examines how much of the gender wage gap can be explained away by the differences in mathematical majors between men
and women.

**_New-Hampshire-Predict_** tries to predict the New Hampshire primary results based on previous election polling data.
